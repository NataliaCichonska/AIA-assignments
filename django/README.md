Our goal is to create a movie rating platform with Django and Boostrap framework. The
platform conforms to the MVC template. Our platform will be populated with data from the
Movie-Lens dataset. If you have any problems with Bootstrap consult Bootstrap 5 Tutorial
(w3schools.com).

1. Suggest a data model for your project. We are going to implement the following
functionalities:
a. A guest user can search for a specific movie with the following filters:
i. Genre,
ii. Movie Title,
iii. Minimum rating.
b. A guest viewer can view the details of a movie by clicking on an item in the
search list. Details of a movie contain the following informations:
ii. Average rating of a movie,
iii. Cross reference to IMDB,
iv. Image gallery with one image dedicated as a front image
v. List of comments to the movie
e. Logged in users can post a comment under a movie.
f. Admin users can edit details of a movie.
g. Admin users can add a new movie.
1. Prepare templates for (the templates should extend the layout template):
a. the home page - the home page consists of:
i. a brief introduction to the portal (you can fill it with lorem)
ii. a list the most popular movies (recently)
iii. if a logged in user is viewing the home page - a list of
recommendation (for now, leave it empty)
b. the movie search page - this web page consists of:
i. A search form for genre, title, rating (use required=False in the form
definition)
ii. list of search results (consider several formats of the list: a table,
continuous list of cards, a list) - one should be able to access a movie
page through the list items
c. the movie page - this web page displays all movie data, including the movie
images, comments, title, average rating, user rating (if logged in); access to
the actions, such as posting a comment (if logged in); editing a movie (if
admin)
d. admin page - this web page is only visible to an administrator user, it contains
a form, which allows an admin to add a new movie.
1. Implement the view functions, forms and add paths to the urls.py.
2. Add hyperlinks to the movie search and homepage to the navigation bar.
Thatâ€™s it for the 1st part of the assignment.
